# Consentulip

Consentulip is a game in which the player encourages their budded flower to grow by stimulating it with various gestures. As the player consensually stimulates the flower, it will slowly bloom and eventually pollinate to indicate that the player has successfully made the flower grow to its fullest potential. However, if the player touches the flower in a non consensual way, the flower will shake and begin to wilt. If the player does not stop the unwanted gestures even though the flower is in pain, the flower will eventually die. The player will have the ability to ask for, give, and revoke consent at any point of the game.
